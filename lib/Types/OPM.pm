=head2 OPMVersion

An OPM version looks like 2.4.5 or 6.0.1.

=head2 OPMVersionWildcard

An OPM version with wildcard as used in Addons. To define a version of the OPM framework
that is needed to install the addon, the developer can use 'x' as a wildcard.

E.g. Addons for OPM 6.x can be installed on any OPM 6 installation, whilst addons that
define 2.4.x as the framework version can only installed on any OPM 2.4 installation, but
not on OPM 2.3 installation.

=head2 OPMFile

An object of L<OPM::Parser>.

It checks if the file exists and can be parsed without an error.
