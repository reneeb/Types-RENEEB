=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Types::RENEEB> is a collection of types I need very often

=head1 MODULES

These C<Types::> modules are shipped in this distribution:

=over 4

=item * L<Types::Dist>

=item * L<Types::OTRS>

=back

C<Types::RENEEB> inherits the types of the mentioned modules.

=head2 Types::Dist

=head3 DistFQ

I<DistName>-I<DistVersion>

    package MyClass;

    use Moo;
    use Types::Dist qw(DistName);

    has dist => ( is => 'ro', isa => DistName );

    1;

And then use your class:

    my $object   = MyClass->new( dist => 'Types-RENEEB-0.09' );
    my $object   = MyClass->new( dist => '0.09' );         # fails
    my $object   = MyClass->new( dist => 'Types-RENEEB' ); # fails

=head3 DistName

A name of a distribution

    my $object   = MyClass->new( dist => 'Types-RENEEB' ); # ok

=head3 DistVersion

A version of a distribution

    my $object   = MyClass->new( dist => '0.09' ); # ok

=head3 CPANfile

An instance of L<Module::CPANfile>

    package MyClass;

    use Moo;
    use Types::Dist qw(CPANfile);

    has prereqs => ( is => 'ro', isa => CPANfile, coerce => 1 );

    1;

And then use your class:

    my $object   = MyClass->new( prereqs => '/path/to/cpanfile' );
    my @features = $object->prereqs->features; # call features method from Module::CPANfile

=head2 Types::OTRS

=head3 OTRSVersion

An OTRS version looks like 2.4.5 or 6.0.1.

=head3 OTRSVersionWildcard

An OTRS version with wildcard as used in Addons. To define a version of the OTRS framework
that is needed to install the addon, the developer can use 'x' as a wildcard.

E.g. Addons for OTRS 6.x can be installed on any OTRS 6 installation, whilst addons that
define 2.4.x as the framework version can only installed on any OTRS 2.4 installation, but
not on OTRS 2.3 installation.

=head3 OPMFile

An object of L<OTRS::OPM::Parser>.

It checks if the file exists and can be parsed without an error.

=head3 COERCIONS

=head4 OPMFile

=over 4

=item * From String to OTRS::OPM::Parser

When a string is given, it is coerced into an L<OTRS::OPM::Parser> object.
