=head2 OTRSVersion

An OTRS version looks like 2.4.5 or 6.0.1.

=head2 OTRSVersionWildcard

An OTRS version with wildcard as used in Addons. To define a version of the OTRS framework
that is needed to install the addon, the developer can use 'x' as a wildcard.

E.g. Addons for OTRS 6.x can be installed on any OTRS 6 installation, whilst addons that
define 2.4.x as the framework version can only installed on any OTRS 2.4 installation, but
not on OTRS 2.3 installation.
